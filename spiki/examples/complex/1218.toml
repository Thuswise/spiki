<Bullingdon>    It's a very common mistake to think of an enemy as a single entity.
                The larger an organization is, the more riven it is with rivalries.
<Chalgrove>     A really big firm is just a cluster of fiefdoms.
<Bullingdon>    The only thing they share is the name.
<Chalgrove>     Underneath it's all chaos. I've seen it myself.
<Appleby>       What are you suggesting?
<Bullingdon>    Let's start gathering some competitive intelligence.
<Chalgrove>     A new project?
<Bullingdon>    A new project, a new formation, a new address.

                Happy now, Appleby?
