<Appleby>       I'm back again. I thought I heard some shouting. "They've closed the bridges".
                So I ran down to English Bridge and it was blocked. There was a cordon across it.

A pair of large rubbish bins in the alley across from them were stamped with that very label.

They looked about them.

Ten red flags which hung from the Market House were embroidered with one identical word.

Even the Cenotaph bore the brand of Reciprocus.
