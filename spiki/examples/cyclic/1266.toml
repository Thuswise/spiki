Let me remind you about Appleby. Because he's hard to pin down.

Appleby has no history. His consciousness is a parade of morphing images and transient sensations.
He lives only by the light of this internal projection.
It is the means by which he communicates with many worlds.
Appleby is a character not without contradictions.
He is in a continual struggle of dreaming himself somewhere
and having all the while to reconcile with the contemporaneous sensations of his physical disposition.

So you may find him twitchy.

Watchful, discriminating.
Uncommitted investigator.
Street scene.

Appleby doesn't care to be in charge. He understands there's no such thing.
