About Broadstairs.
The handshake. The letterhead. The signature on the cheque.
Not longhand, but in understated initials.
His word is his bond. The word of Broadstairs comes as a nod.
No poker face. An iron keel.

Appleby regards the [shopfront suspiciously](1266.html).
Chalgrove is unhappy too, but why?
He's looking at his watch. If they follow [the river](4578.html), they can loop back in time for the train.

Broadstairs needs convincing. He has half a mind to [call it a day](4646.html).
Otherwise, what's wrong with a [pub](1136.html)?
