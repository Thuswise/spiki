Broadstairs leads on. He is upright and smart on every bearing.
He is gaff-rigged with an iron keel.

To consult with Broadstairs is to encounter an ancient soul.
To engage him awakens a mighty foe.
His letterhead crowns only solemn undertakings.
His monogram makes most weighty the deed.

And when he gives his Word, his Word comes not with a word.
He is sincere in every syllable. So will be unable to repeat what was said.
The Word of Broadstairs is a nod. An affirming smile. An intoxicating handshake.

And now, as he strides up St Mary's towards the Dogpole, he radiates an aureole
of illocutionary assurance.

Appleby regards the [shopfront suspiciously](1266.html).
Chalgrove is unhappy too, but why?
He's looking at his watch. If they follow [the river](4578.html), they can loop back in time for the train.

Broadstairs needs convincing. He has half a mind to [call it a day](4646.html).
Otherwise, what's wrong with a [pub](1136.html)?
